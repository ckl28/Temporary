	-The worker class benefits from the Interface Segregation Principle as it 
	 implements both the IWorkable and IFeedable interfaces, 
	 which are necessary for the class. 
	-The Single Responsibility Principle did not apply as it did not need to be 
	 broken up into separate classes.
	-The Open Close Principle did apply as it is written in a way that allows 
	 for simple extension, without having to edit the existing code.
